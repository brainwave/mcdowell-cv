# mcdowell-cv
A Nice-looking CV template made into LaTeX

Overleaf and Sharelatex compatible versions of class defined in dnl-blkv/mcdowell-cv (tweaks on version obtained from https://latexresu.me/). Files contained are -

1. overleaf_opensans - uses inbuilt open sans font instead of calibri.
2. overleaf_calibri - uses custom calibri font.

Make sure that you have only **one** class file since both version provide the same package mcdowellcv to the tex files.

The unix/linux default Times New Roman font with OpenSans. Operating system check removed from the class file.

Calibri fonts used here have been pulled from https://github.com/developwithpassion/devtools/tree/master/shared/extra_fonts/ms_fonts.


# TO DO
1. Clean up directory structure
2. Check if calibri is legal to include
3. Create License
4. Improve readme
5. Include class files modified for my own resume
